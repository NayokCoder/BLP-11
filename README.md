  A brief description.
  -I am building a player selection feature, possibly for a sports or auction-related app. In this component, users can choose players from a list, with the following conditions:

Price Limitation: If a player's bidding price exceeds a certain amount, a warning is shown.
Duplicate Check: If a player is already selected, an error message is displayed.
Maximum Limit: Only up to six players can be chosen; otherwise, an alert appears.
Price Adjustment: When a player is successfully selected, the total price is updated.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
